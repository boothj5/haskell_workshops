List.hs
-------

Function type signaures and broken implementation are here for the exercises.

listHead
listTail
listSize
listGet
listMap

To test your implementations, make sure the following are in the same directory:

List.hs
ListTests.hs
runtests.sh

Make sure runtests.sh is executable and just call:

./runtests.sh

..to run the tests.

(I don't know how to run it on windows, can't be much different)

You need HUnit installed.
